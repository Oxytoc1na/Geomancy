SOUL FORGE
- activated with the activate spell component
- takes pedestals of mana-storers and ingredients
- requires rune blocks
-- may be dwarven (theme: stability)
-- may be stellgian (theme: cost reduction & bonuses)
- for high level items such as
-- large spell gloves, spell cradle, soul storage, and varpot
-- soul bore
-- caster core
-- casting armor
-- surrounding molten gold increases stability

crafting process concept
-> put required ingredients around forge in pedestals
-> put soul storers in pedestals
-> gui shows three bars: souls available, taken souls/required souls, instability
-> gui shows which ingredients are subsumed vs which still need to be to complete the craft
-> cast activate on the main block
-> hitting the main block with a hammer now consumes soul from each soul-storing pedestal each time
--> (with a sparkly particle effect!! (make it feel impactful (camshake?)))
-> depending on progress, items get subsumed
-> the longer it takes to craft, the more unstable the craft becomes
--> explosion on full, abort
--> flood the main block with water to prematurely and more safely cancel the craft
--> subsumed items up to that point are lost


PROGRESSION

gloves (number in parentheses is storage capacity):
- novice (5): leather, titanium, made at smithery, used to initially activate the soulforge
from hereon out, made at soulforge
- apprentice (9): leather, titanium, mithril, octangulite
- journeyman (9*2): previous + phantom membrane, octangulite, stellge tech
- expert (9*4): previous + end ingredients (dragons breath, shulker shell)
- master (9*6): TODO null dimension & endgame content

start
-> new ores
-> smithing
-> surface structures
-> octangula
-> spell components & spellmaker
-> apprentice spellglove
-> octangulite
-> smithing the components necessary for a ritualistic forge
-> smithing a basic spellglove
-> activate component unlocked
-> ritualistic forge unlocked

"Exodia" spell quest chain
- the "exodia" spell is a theoretical soulcasting apparatus that activates certain  highly specialized
components in a specific order while fulfilling certain requirements for each one.
successfully casting the "exodia" spell allows for communication with the over-gods in the null dimension
and unlocks geomancys endgame content.
components in order of progression:
- ?1: "the challenge of soul" : unlocked from a recipe in a stellgian lore book (prospecting studies) found in the digsite overworld structure
-- activation requirements: activate while in a location with 1000+ ambient souls
- ?2: "the challenge of math" : unlocked from a recipe in a stellgian lore book (dimensional exploration) found in a nether bastion
-- activation requirements: provide a list signal containing you, the number -23, and the position of you with y=-64
-- answer a riddle
-- riddle is randomized per world seed, per dimension
-- "This realm yearns for the following: provide a spell that reverses a given string."
tasks:
- reverse a string text -> text
- sort a list of numbers [num] -> [num] (sorted)
- solve the pythagorean theorem for c [num (a),num (b)] -> num (c)
- return the ! of a num num (in) -> num (in!)

- ?3: "the challenge of recklessness" : unlocked from a recipe in a lore book of unknown origin (dwarven cult) found in an ancient city
-- activation requirements: play the enderdragon death sound event while standing in an ancient city
-- this will inevitably anger the skulk sensors in the area and summon a warden
- ?4: "the challenge of curiosity" : unlocked from a recipe in a stellgian lore book (dimensional outer rim studies) found in an end city
-- activation requirements: cast while so deep in the void that you'll take damage if you stay
- ?5: "the challenge of absolution" : unlocked from researching a big structure found in the null dimension
-- activation requirements: summon lightning ontop of the roof of the null dimension
-- if all other exodia components have successfully been triggered by the caster, this
lets them achieve enlightenment and have a vision of the over-deities communing with them.

ender dragon defeated
-> dimhop component unlocked, crafted at ritualistic forge
-> null dimension unlocked
