fixed

SOUL FORGE
- activated with the activate spell component
- takes pedestals of mana-storers and ingredients
- requires rune blocks
-- may be dwarven (theme: stability)
-- may be stellgian (theme: cost reduction & bonuses)
- for high level items such as
-- large spell gloves, spell cradle, soul storage, and varpot
-- soul bore
-- caster core
-- casting armor
-- surrounding molten gold increases stability

crafting process concept
-> put required ingredients around forge in pedestals
-> put soul storers in pedestals
-> gui shows three bars: souls available, taken souls/required souls, instability
-> gui shows which ingredients are subsumed vs which still need to be to complete the craft
-> cast activate on the main block
-> hitting the main block with a hammer now consumes soul from each soul-storing pedestal each time
--> (with a sparkly particle effect!! (make it feel impactful (camshake?)))
-> depending on progress, items get subsumed
-> the longer it takes to craft, the more unstable the craft becomes
--> explosion on full, abort
--> flood the main block with water to prematurely and more safely cancel the craft
--> subsumed items up to that point are lost
