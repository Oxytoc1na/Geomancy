- tourmaline ore break particles unset
- spellcomponents without a recipe:
-- imbue
-- function 2
- guidebook no recipe
- smelt times too fast
- plumbometer missing texture
- rebalance gems and pendants
-- i got fortune 55 using mithril armor, octangulite rings and a pendant and emeralds
-- tourmalines suck
- no soul plank recipe
- no soul log debarking
- no stellge lore in loottables
- spell component pouch desperately needed!!!
- paranoia needs to last longer
-- also throw in thunder sounds and cave noises
- whispers are too annoying
- octangulas are too common
-- remove diamonds from their loot tables
--- i skipped all of tool progression within 10 minutes of spawning in like what
---- i mean it made my life a lot easier testing all the other things but still thats not good game design
