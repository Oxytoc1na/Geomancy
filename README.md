# Geomancy is a story-based adventure mod, featuring:
- smithing jewelry and socketing gems in them
- uncovering the story of large, ancient ruins buried underneith the worlds mountains
- discovering a unique, otherworldy yet technological spin on spellcasting
- losing ones mind
- lead poisoning

It adds several new ores, such as lead, titanium, mithril and molybdenum, and one strange outlier thats hard to describe.
Don't worry, it'll tell you more itself.
_...Maybe it's better if you don't listen, though._
